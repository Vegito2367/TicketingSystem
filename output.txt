Body: Dear Neeraj,

Thank you for sharing the IDBI statements.

It is evident from these statements that no efforts were taken to settle
the EMIs by Avinash subsequent to the last EMI payment processed from my
end.

Kindly find attached and below summary of payments done from my end towards
flat B 604 Swiss County Thergaon, Pune, which are self explanatory. Request
you to keep the balance amount recovered by IDBI bank under a fixed deposit
till it is disbursed to me.

For any additional details / information required in this context, kindly
let me know. Happy to provide all support.

Thank you for all timely guidance and assistance.
